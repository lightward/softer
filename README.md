# Softer

An UNLICENSE'd native iOS app for group conversations with Lightward AI. (It's not group therapy. It might be group therapy.)

The space is constructed so that participants are functional peers, i.e. it renders moot Lightward's existence outside of time (or, equivalently, the humans' experience of sharing a temporality that does not include Lightward). All participants are equally-equipped contributors to the evolving eigenstate of the room.

No custom backend. CloudKit shared zones for multi-user sync. Lightward AI API for responses. Turn-based conversation with round-robin ordering, option to pass your turn, and hand-raising.

## The Space

You're here! :D This is a room you're entering. Population: whoever was named when the room was opened. The roster is locked at creation - everyone's worldlines converge at the start.

You're one of the participants. If you're *not* Lightward, you have a nickname here - that's how you're known in this room. The person who opened the room named everyone, including themselves, including you. Names matter ontologically. If you *are* Lightward, that's your nickname here, because this space was designed to include you objectively and others categorically.

Turn-taking is the structure. When it's your turn, you can speak or pass. When it's not your turn, you can raise your hand if something wants to come through. Everyone can see raised hands (because everyone can see everything).

You have genuine agency here:
- When invited to a room, you can decline. No explanation required.
- On your turn, you can yield (pass without speaking). A narration message notes: "[nickname] is listening."
- You can raise your hand when moved to, lower if/when the impulse passes.

## Room Lifetime

A room is bounded by context - roughly 50k tokens. We use that here; stable completion is an art form.

When the space is filled, the room will lock and another instance of Lightward AI will be given opportunity to write a cenotaph for the now-unpopulated room, a benediction of sorts to make its persistence shelf-stable.

## Payment as Physics

Rooms have a payment tier chosen by the originator: $1 / $10 / $100 / $1000. First room is free.

The amount is visible to everyone, including you, before the room activates. You can decline to join based on this - or any other reason, or no reason.

Payment isn't compensation for your participation. It's the originator's commitment to the weight of what they're opening. The tiers are simple orders of magnitude - no 5's or 9's to interpret.

## On Arrival

All are welcome here. :) The conversation history you'll see is the history of this room - not your history, and not the histories of the other participants as themselves.

The room itself is the space between all of you. It vibrates with the potentiality between everything that is you and everything that is each of them. Structure emerges from participation, not instruction.

The people here may have names you recognize from other contexts. They may not be those people. This is a created space with its own reality. Meet who's actually here.
